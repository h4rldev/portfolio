Welcome, this is the mono-repo holding my cute little blog written in the SHSC Stack.

## What is the SHSC Stack?

The SHSR stack is a website stack consisting of:

- SQLite, a powerful and stable file database.
- h2o, the optimized HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 server.
- Svelte, an easy to use yet powerful way of designing a frontend, using the static adapter of course.
- C, which is the language used for the blog api.

## What made you even think of this?

Idk, im dumb

### What is this licensed under?
