Welcome, this is the mono-repo holding my portfolio written in the FASR stack

## What is the SASR Stack?

The SASR stack is an website stack consisting of:

- SQLite, stable single file db
- Axum, a rust web framework.
- Svelte, an easy to use yet powerful way of designing a frontend, using the static adapter of course.
- Rust, which is the language used for the backend, as axum is written in rust.

## What made you even think of this?

Idk, it's funny

### What is this licensed under?

The frontend & backend is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.
See the LICENSE file [here](LICENSE) for more information.
